### 📁 Completed Engineering Projects

#### ⚡ 6-Channel STM32 PWM Driver Board
*Designed and manufactured as part of the Engineering Design-1 course.*
* Engineered a high-precision 6-channel PWM driver board based on the **STM32** microcontroller.
* Conducted the full hardware design lifecycle in **Altium Designer**, including schematic capture and optimized PCB routing.
* Authored technical documentation and progress reports detailing power efficiency and signal stability.

#### 🎤  Morse Code Decoder With TI MSP430
*Real-time signal processing*
* I used the MSP430G2553 microcontroller to sample signals from a microphone sensor via its ADC, distinguish pulse durations to decode Morse code, and then display the decoded characters on an LCD over I²C.
* Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in microcontroller programming, the I²C communication protocol, and the use of sensors and ADCs in embedded systems
